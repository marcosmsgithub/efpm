Here an algorithmic proposal for the envy-free perfect matching problem is presented.

The maximum weight perfect matching is obtained by the Hungarian method, 
and then the proposed algorithm for determining the optimal envy-free prices is executed 
and then compared with the Bellman-Ford algorithm, using the same instances.
